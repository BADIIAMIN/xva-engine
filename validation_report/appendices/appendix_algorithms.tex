\section{Appendix C — Algorithmic implementation and benchmark model}
\label{app:algorithms}

\subsection{Hull--White one-factor (HW1F) model}

The Hull--White one-factor model specifies the short rate as:
\[
r(t) = x(t) + \phi(t),
\]
where $x(t)$ follows an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process:
\[
dx(t) = -a\,x(t)\,dt + \sigma\,dW_t.
\]

The deterministic shift $\phi(t)$ is chosen to fit the initial term structure exactly.

\subsubsection{Zero-coupon bond prices}

Under HW1F, the zero-coupon bond price admits the closed form:
\[
P(t,T)
=
A(t,T)\exp\!\left(-B(t,T)\,r(t)\right),
\]
with:
\[
B(t,T) = \frac{1 - e^{-a(T-t)}}{a},
\]
and $A(t,T)$ determined to match the initial yield curve.

\subsubsection{Calibration}

Model parameters $(a,\sigma)$ are calibrated by minimizing the discrepancy between
model-implied and market-observed swaption volatilities:
\[
\min_{a,\sigma}
\sum_{i}
\left(
\sigma_{\text{model}}^{\text{swaption}}(i)
-
\sigma_{\text{market}}^{\text{swaption}}(i)
\right)^2.
\]

HW1F is arbitrage-free by construction and therefore serves as a suitable benchmark
for structural diagnostics.

\subsection{Algorithmic computation of diagnostics}

\subsubsection{DF monotonicity heatmap}

For each simulation time and maturity interval:
\begin{verbatim}
	for time i:
	for maturity k:
	violations = mean(DF[:,i,k+1] > DF[:,i,k])
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Kink index bands}

\begin{verbatim}
	for time i:
	for path n:
	kink[n] = sum_k |Z[n,i,k+1] - 2 Z[n,i,k] + Z[n,i,k-1]|
	compute median and quantiles of kink
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Wedge statistics}

\begin{verbatim}
	for maturity T:
	for path n:
	wedge = log(P(T+u)) - log(P(T)) - log(P_hat(T,T+u))
	compute histogram and p95(|wedge|)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Reproducibility and governance considerations}

All diagnostics are computed under fixed random seeds and deterministic
configuration files. Output artefacts are versioned by model configuration,
ensuring traceability between reported figures and underlying simulations.
